# Fieldnotes

*These notes serve to collect many of the projects, writing, people, and Big Ideas that I have found particularly exciting or enriching over the past few years. The following items are not listed in order of my having been introduced to them, but rather are organized in groups with links to help connect project to author, author to project, idea to concrete example, or example to Big Idea. I often reference the following works and people when I talk with friends, so I have attempted to create a catalogue raisonn√© of sorts for both myself and others. I cherish the assortment of things here so much that I'm afraid to lose them; this is an attempt to pin down some of the notes bumping around in my head. Some links may go bad over time. Sorry about that!*

***Bold listings indicate books that I'm planning to read**.

### Technical writing ###

[Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) (2006) by Bret Victor. Explores the different types of software we use, and drills down into the unique challenge of designing software whose purpose is to present information to the user. The Importance of context-sensitive information graphics is illustrated through a case study: Bret Victor's widely acclaimed BART widget for tracking train schedules.

[The Autodesk File](https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/) (1994) by John Walker. The founder of Autodesk (AutoCAD) is a brilliant engineer and a prolific writer. His famous missives to his employees and a thoughtful analysis of the early events of his company are presented in a fascinating narrative. "The book traces the company from the first glimmer of an idea in the minds of the founders, through start-up, initial public stock offering, and growth from a loose confederation of moonlighting individuals to a leader in the industry of computer aided design."

[Paul Ford's What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). It's an interactive article. It's over 38,000 words. The basic fundamentals of computing, from AND/OR gates to high level programming languages, is delivered in a playful, sometimes tongue-in-cheek manner; this occurs because the technical overview Ford provides is woven around a narrative of real-world software industry problems, which involve issues of ego, productivity, mismanagement and misallocation of resources ($$$). Accessible to laypeople.

[Ramblings in Real Time](http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/) by Micheal Abrash. Discussion of the video game Quake's 3D engine, specifically the problem of determining which  polygons need to be drawn, and which are occluded by monsters, walls, and other game world objects. Though much of the material is over my head, the high-level discussion of strategies for approaching a challenge as difficult as creating a 3D engine (let alone creating a new one every week) provide an excellent model for technical writing. Micheal Abrash is a gifted programmer and computer scientist, and his clarity of thinking extends to his writing. His precision in writing about technical processes and the creative processes that take place within a software design process is something I strive to emulate. A [PDF](http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/abrash.pdf) also available.

[Visualizing Algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) by Mike Bostock. Great example of an interactive essay. Very much inspired by Bret Victor's (Victorianism?) principals of presentation.

[How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) by Mike Bostock. Interactive presentation of an API. Pretty great. Was peer reviewed and shaped by consultation with these big names: Anna Powell-Smith, Scott Murray, Nelson Minar, Tom Carden, Shan Carter, Jason Davies, Tom MacWright and [John Firebaugh](http://jfire.io/animations/).

[How to Scroll](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/scroll/) by Mike Bostock. A short piece on User Interaction and expected behavior.

[D3: Data-Driven Documents](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/d3) by [Michael Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), [Vadim Ogievetsky](http://vadim.ogievetsky.com/), [Jeffrey Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/). The white paper produced at Stanford. D3.js is brought into the world, and it is beautiful. enter(), update(), exit().

[Anything written by Evan Chen](http://www.mit.edu/~evanchen/index.html). MIT RSI. Harvard '18. Brilliant guy with an obsessive interest in typesetting and thorough note-taking. Most of the math is way over my head, but I've learned a bit about note-taking from him. He regards his notes and reams of scratch work as a form of external memory. I've to say, external memory does take some of the burden off of my already limited and heavily-taxed mind. On the technical side, I've used his LaTex [sample file](https://stuff.mit.edu/~evanchen/handouts/TeXSample/) for typesetting tips and some best-practices examples for typesetting math symbols and equations. I started writing up [solutions](https://www.dropbox.com/home/sharelatex/Proofs%20Involving%20Conjunctions%20and%20Biconditionals?preview=Proofs_Involving_Conjunctions_and_Biconditionals.pdf) to Daniel J. Velleman's *How To Prove It* book for practice. My current workflow is to solve things on paper, and use the process of typesetting my notes as a chance to review what I've done.


### Short videos ###

[Flying Lotus - Tiny Tortures](https://vimeo.com/54585743) (2012) by [David Lewandowski](http://www.dlew.me/). The [Process video](https://vimeo.com/54551393) shows all the behind-the-scenes Cinema 4D wizardry.

[Box](https://vimeo.com/75260457) by BOT & DOLLY. Large obotic arms and projection mapping. After seeing this video, I applied to work there. I was told to apply again the following year after getting some more robotics courses under my belt. When I checked back, BOT & DOLLY was gone. Acquired by Google. Their sister Company was [Autofuss](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3017332?trk=prof-0-ovw-prev_pos). Notable people involved with the project include [Ian Colon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iancolon) and [Conor Grebel](https://vimeo.com/52028760).



### Talks ###

[The Genius of the System](https://vimeo.com/55887144) by [Luc Sante](http://lucsante.com/). The way Luc Sante approaches photography, paying particular attention to aspect of *chance* that seems unique to photography. I first encountered Luc Sante's writing and talks when I was at NYU for the Writers in New York program, led by Joanna Yas. During the summer of 2014, I experimented with street photography for the first time. I'm proud of my [results](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brooksmershon/albums/72157644518138170). Near the end of the summer, I wrote a short piece called [Flickr](https://github.com/bmershon/word/blob/master/Essays/2014/flickr.pdf), wherein I reflected on some on my new experiences with photography. Luc Sante inspired me to give some serious thought to photography. His words pushed me to consider how photography might help me cultivate creativity in a way that was natural, and not forced.

[Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://vimeo.com/64895205) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/). "People are alive -- they behave and respond. Creations within the computer can also live, behave, and respond... if they are allowed to."

[The Humane Presentation of Thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289) (2014) by Bret Victor. First he talks about the past. Then he talks about the future. This talk has to do with how we communicate with one another, and how we try to express what's in our heads in order to help us make intellectual progress.


### Interactive, Explorable Things ###

[Parable of the Paragons](http://ncase.me/polygons/) by [Vi hart](http://vihart.com/) and [Nicky Case](https://www.patreon.com/ncase?ty=h). Cute interactive aimed at explaining how local biases (towards race, for example) create global biases.

[Coming Out Simulator](http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014) by Nicky Case. Amazing. This is [Affective Computing](http://affect.media.mit.edu/) in action.


### Clever Projects (by clever people) ###

[Center for Missed Connections](http://centerformissedconnections.info/) by [Ingrid Burrington](http://lifewinning.com/about). I have much love for her. She thinks hard about human problems, such as loneliness in the city (Center for Missed Connections) or the procedures of a high-profile court case like the trial of Bradley Manning. She looks for meaning and throws her cleverness in that direction, leveraging her skills as a writer, data scientist, and developer to communicate the connections she sees. Her work always leaves me with the impression that it is clever, necessary, and more relevent to my life than other work on which I heap praise.

[Loop Ditty Geometric Music Visualizer](http://bigdata.duke.edu/sites/bigdata.duke.edu/files/images/ctralie_DataExpeditions_writeup-1.pdf) by Chris Tralie. He led a lab in a course taught by Paul Bendich at Duke in 2014. As a grad student in the Duke Math department (Princeton undergraduate degree in ECE), he introduced my class to a real-world example of computation topology, using his own research project as a subject for a Matlab-based homework project designed for undergraduates. Although the actual mechanics of the stuff he introduced to my class went over our heads, he did an excellent job of communicating the big ideas and patterns. His site and lab work point to the opportunity to introduce more real-world at earlier stages of a student's academic career, with the hopes of better illustrating where he or she is headed, as well as inspiring them to keep climbing to higher and higher levels within their field so that they can do *the cool stuff*. Writing equations for homework with pencil and paper is one thing, but seeing a song analyzed in 50 dimensional space and then projected into 3 dimensional space is sometimes a useful exercise and source of motivation for further study.

### Essays ###

[The Numbers](http://mrbellersneighborhood.com/2002/03/the-numbers) by Bryan Charles. First person account of being in the Twin Towers when the planes struck. One of many great stories to find its way into [Mr. Beller's Neighborhood](http://mrbellersneighborhood.com/). Thomas Beller came and spoke at one of my night sessions when I was at NYU. He's a fantastic storyteller. I found his site invaluable as a resource during my creative nonfiction seminar.

[Bank Robin' in Brooklyn](https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/help-desk/bank-robbin-in-brooklyn/) by Kristin Dombek. Dombek writes for The Help Desk, a section of [n+1 Magazine](https://nplusonemag.com/) which provides serious, though often seemingly ironic responses to questions submitted by readers. Dombek draws on her own life experiences to deliver a beautiful response to a reader struggling with meaninglessness in their employment.

[Both Ways](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-22/essays/both-ways/) by Kristen Dombek. Exploring the difficulties of bisexuality and polyamorous relationships.

[A Hollywood Screenwriter](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-23/essays/a-hollywood-screenwriter/) by Kristen Dombek. On the proclivity towards depression that many artistic, political, academic, and literary types tend to exhibit. How to move forward, to laugh at the transience of our despair and, yes, step towards a reasonable form of enlightenment.

### Photography ###

[Chase Jarvis](http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/live/) is successful because of his natural creative talent, as well as his business acumen. Beyond the technical skills he teaches in his [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-6EQo6it7Y), he brings well thought out strategies for folks attempting to pursue any creative endeavor. Perhaps his most important quality is his ability to attract other creative and successful people and promote conversation around creative endeavors.

[La fille renne](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cecileb). Portraits and some NSFW stuff.

[deadslow](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deadslow/). Cars, mainly around San Francisco.

[lomokev](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/). Based in Brighton, England. Lots of [swimming in cold water](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/15717959964/in/dateposted/).



### Podcasts ###

[Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) is well known for the [The 4 Hour Body](http://fourhourbody.com/). His particular brand of life-hacking tends to lead to polarized reactions. Some love him, some find his stuff silly. His podcasts, however, are extremely entertaining. He has long conversations with friends he knows who are world-class in something, be it a chef at a Michelin three star restaurant, a martial arts champion, a chess prodigy, or an investment banker. Each episode is naturally tailored to the person he is interviewing, but each hour or so discussion includes several rapid-fire questions like "What book do you find yourself gifting most frequently" and "What is your morning routine." The lessons you can learn from his guests' responses is incredibly useful, and the life experiences shared are varied and fascinating.


### Math ###

[How to Prove It](http://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1439932778&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+prove+it) by Daniel J. Velleman. Clearly written, extremely useful introduction to proof techniques, with an introduction to set theory serving as the first material on which the reader can exercise the proof writing skills.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) saved my ass in high school biology and college Linear Algebra courses.

[MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). Useful if you would like to learn something well and are highly motivated. Saved my ass in a college Linar Algebra course. Helped me get like a 100% on the final.

[Linear Algebra Done Right](http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387982582) by Sheldon Axler. I was told to by this book after talking to Paul Bendich from my Computational Topology course. We both agreed that despite getting a good grade in Linear Algebra, I didn't understand some of the abstract aspects of linear algebra that are necessary to play in the higher-level courses. This book tries to avoid too much matrix stuff before the more abstract understand of vector spaces and operations are in place. Wish I'd started there, and not with [Ted Shifrin's book](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_19?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=linear+algebra+a+geometric+approach&sprefix=linear+algebra+a+geometric+approach%2Cstripbooks%2C135). Shifrin's book is *why* I needed MIT Open Courseware's Gilbert Strang to do well in my linear algebra course. *shudders*.


### Computer Sciency Things ###

[Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/). When Mike Bostock minifies his code, the result is *longer*. In data visualization circles, he is regarded as The Second Coming.

[Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/). Collaborator with Mike Bostock. Freelance data visualization wizard.

### Visual Design ###

[Nicholas Feltron](http://feltron.com/). You can see his design chops change throughout his portoflio as he experiments with form in infographics.

[Todd Lindemann](https://t.co/kSTxZGhhZJ). High quality graphic design, diagrams, and cutaway graphics. Thoughtful presentation of statistics (sports, economics, timelines, cause-and-effect) in novel forms.


### Physical and Industrial Design ###

[Skylar Tibbits](https://vimeo.com/70660109) is the director of the Self-Assembly lab at MIT.

[MIT Architecture program overview](https://vimeo.com/47845783).

### Nonfiction Books ###

[Better](http://www.amazon.com/Better-A-Surgeons-Notes-Performance/dp/0312427654) by Atul Gawande.

[Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1439932673&sr=1-1&keywords=elon+musk) by Ashlee Vance.

[My Struggle](http://www.amazon.com/My-Struggle-Karl-Ove-Knausgaard/dp/1935744860). I've read the third book of the 6-part series. He's a contemporary literary superstar for a reason, and that reason is not his gorgeous Nordic hair.

[Delerious New York](http://www.amazon.com/Delirious-New-York-Retroactive-Manifesto/dp/1885254008) by Rem Koolhaas. Coney Island as an expression of human ingenuity and willingness to experiment with architectural form. Luna Park and the Incubator building, where "old technology sanctions new technology." Elisha Otis's demonstration of an elevator's safety mechanisms: the dramatic cutting of the elevator's rope by its creator standing on the platform and the subsequent failure of any harm to come to him. "The anticlimax as denouement, the non-event as triumph."

[Consider the Lobster](http://www.amazon.com/Consider-Lobster-Essays-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316013323) by David Foster Wallace. Wallace follows John Mccain on the campaign trail, reporting for Rolling Stone Magazine. A philosophical treatment of consciousness sparked by a concern for the pain lobsters feel when humans happily pitch them into boiling caldrons of water. And other essays.


### Fiction books ###

[The Satanic Verses](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_5_10?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=salman+rushdie+satanic+verses&sprefix=salman+rushdie+satanic+verses%2Cstripbooks%2C156) by Salmon Rushdie.
