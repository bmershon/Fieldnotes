Brooks Mershon's fieldnotes
=============================

[Books](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Nonfiction-Books), [essays](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Essays), [films](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Film) and [other resources](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Technical-Writing) I have found to be particularly great or enriching.

Entries are usually ordered by appending new materials as I encounter them to an continually growing list on each particular page of this wiki. I especially like to keep track of those materials which do not reside on my bookshelf, so that I may read/watch/listen again, recommend these resources to a friend, and recall where I have been.

I started faithfully recording toward the end of my undergraduate studies, so high school canon and a good deal of other materials have not made it to the list.

This is my garden that I find great pleasure in cultivating.

I've organized this material into the [wiki pages for this respository](https://github.com/bmershon/Fieldnotes/wiki).
