# Fieldnotes

*These notes serve to collect all the projects, writing, people, and Big Ideas that I have found particularly exciting or enriching over the past few years. The items are not listed in order of my having been introduced to them, but rather are organized in groups with links to help connect project to author, author to project, idea to concrete example, or example to Big Idea. I reference the following people, projects, and pieces often when I talk with friends, so I have attempted to create a catalogue raisonn√© of sorts for both myself and others. I cherish the assortment of things here so much that I'm afraid to lose them; this is an attempt to pin down some of the notes bumping around in my head. Some links may go bad over time. Sorry about that!

### Technical writing ###

[Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) (2006) by Bret Victor. Explores the different types of software we use, and drills down into the unique challenge of designing software whose purpose is to present information to the user. The Importance of context-sensitive information graphics is illustrated through a case study: Bret Victor's widely acclaimed BART widget for tracking train schedules.

[The Autodesk File](https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/) (1994) by John Walker. The founder of Autodesk (AutoCAD) is a brilliant engineer and a prolific writer. His famous missives to his employees and a thoughtful analysis of the early events of his company are presented in a fascinating narrative. "The book traces the company from the first glimmer of an idea in the minds of the founders, through start-up, initial public stock offering, and growth from a loose confederation of moonlighting individuals to a leader in the industry of computer aided design."

[Paul Ford's What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). It's an interactive article. It's over 38,000 words. The basic fundamentals of computing, from AND/OR gates to high level programming languages, is delivered in a playful, sometimes tongue-in-cheek manner; this occurs because the technical overview Ford provides is woven around a narrative of real-world software industry problems, which involve issues of ego, productivity, mismanagement and misallocation of resources ($$$). Accessible to laypeople.

[Ramblings in Real Time](http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/) by Micheal Abrash. Discussion of the video game Quake's 3D engine, specifically the problem of determining which  polygons need to be drawn, and which are occluded by monsters, walls, and other game world objects. Though much of the material is over my head, the high-level discussion of strategies for approaching a challenge as difficult as creating a 3D engine (let alone creating a new one every week) provide an excellent model for technical writing. Micheal Abrash is a gifted programmer and computer scientist, and his clarity of thinking extends to his writing. His precision in writing about technical processes and the creative processes that take place within a software design process is something I strive to emulate.
