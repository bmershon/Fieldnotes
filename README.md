# Fieldnotes

*These notes serve to collect many of the projects, writing, people, and Big Ideas that I have found particularly exciting or enriching over the past few years. The following items are not listed in order of my having been introduced to them, but rather are organized in groups with links to help connect project to author, author to project, idea to concrete example, or example to Big Idea. I often reference the following works and people when I talk with friends, so I have attempted to create a catalogue raisonn√© of sorts for both myself and others. I cherish the assortment of things here so much that I'm afraid to lose them; this is an attempt to pin down some of the notes bumping around in my head. Some links may go bad over time. Sorry about that!*

***Bold listings indicate books that I'm planning to read**.

I've organized this material into the [wiki pages for this respository](https://github.com/bmershon/Fieldnotes/wiki).
